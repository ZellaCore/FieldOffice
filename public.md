Ironic hypocrisy this session is rife with anecdotes and hypocritic references to The President and the spreading of hate and violence , when  they the democrats  are the ones curroding with hate and avarice for President Trump and his people. Who shot congressman Steve Scalise? who have been spreading mendatious claims of collusion for almost two years...? Angry Democrats Breed Hate like rats  ...Oops Ranking member Collins i didnt see you ... madam hypocrite apple pie. . thats subtle conceit and hate.
